# Safe Integration Guide for Existing Backend

## 🛡️ Safe Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Standalone Integration (Recommended Start)
- Keep dashboard as separate Next.js app
- Connect to your existing backend via APIs
- No changes to your current codebase
- Test everything before deeper integration

### Phase 2: Gradual Integration
- Add dashboard routes to your existing React app
- Integrate components one by one
- Maintain your current backend structure

### Phase 3: Full Integration (Optional)
- Merge dashboard into main application
- Unified authentication and routing
