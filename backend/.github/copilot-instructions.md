This project is a unified internal reporting dashboard. The backend is FastAPI (Python) and the frontend is React (Vite). The backend should support Excel file uploads, parse department-specific KPIs, and provide endpoints for the frontend to fetch parsed data. The frontend should have department tabs, KPI visualizations, and date range toggling. No database is used; files are stored and parsed on-demand.
